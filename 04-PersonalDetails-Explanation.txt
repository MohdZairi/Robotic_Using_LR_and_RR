Write below a short explanation (how it works, challenges, limitations, etc.) on your simulation answer:


For the right hand rule
-Robot will prior Right first before STRAIGHT and LEFT
-I also provide Each time robot too close to RIGHT WALL,The robot will CURVE LEFT 50 degree 
 and each time robot too close to LEFT WALL,The robot will CURVE RIGHT 50 degree 
-Im using Lidar to detect distance robot with wall and also lidar will scan minimum distance between ROBOT and WALL

For the LEFT hand rule
-Robot will prior LEFT first before STRAIGHT and RIGHT
-I also provide Each time robot too close to LEFT WALL,The robot will CURVE RIGHT 50 degree 
 and each time robot too close to RIGHT WALL,The robot will CURVE LEFT 50 degree 
-Im using Lidar to detect distance robot with wall and also lidar will scan minimum distance between ROBOT and WALL


Each ROBOT using Lidar just for Detect Distance Wall and ROBOT
